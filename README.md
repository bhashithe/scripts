# Custom bash scripts

I have some scripts which I use to make the routines easy in my computer.

* rofishut
* rofiswitch

`rofishut` is a handy shutdown/reboot tool which takes the users input as shutdown/reboot/continue and does exactly that.

`rofiswitch` takes users input as extend left, extend right and copy and deal with the VGA output to give the correct VGA out.
